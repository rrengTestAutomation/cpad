In this emotional documentary, two people from opposite sides of the world talk of its effect on their lives. Japanese teenager Momoka, still coming to terms with the earthquake that decimated her community, finds it the perfect outlet for releasing the anguish she hides inside. For Scottish music student Paul, recovering from his fifth brain surgery, the Ballade was literally life changing - he credits its emotional pull for the return of his memory.
